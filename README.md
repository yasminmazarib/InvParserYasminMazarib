## What to test

### Endpoints

- **POST `/extract`**
- Happy path: valid invoice file → returns extracted structured invoice JSON.
- Validation: missing or invalid file input → returns an error response.
- Low-confidence or unsupported document type handling → returns 400.
- FAILURE: OCI service unavailable → returns 503.
- EDGE CASE: valid document with no extracted fields → returns 200 with empty data.

- **GET `/invoice/{invoice_id}`**
- Happy path: existing invoice ID → returns the invoice details.
- Not found: non-existing invoice ID → returns 404 with a clear message.

- **GET `/invoices/vendor/{vendor_name}`**
- Happy path: vendor with existing invoices → returns vendor details and a list of invoices.
- Not found: vendor with no invoices → returns empty list with total count = 0.

## Test design strategy

- The API is tested using an **integration testing strategy**.
- Tests interact with the API layer using **FastAPI TestClient**, simulating real HTTP requests.
- The database layer is real (SQLite) and initialized before each test.
- Test data is seeded into the database during setup to simulate previous API calls.
- External dependencies (OCI Document AI service) are **mocked** to avoid reliance on external services and credentials.
- This approach validates the integration between:
- API layer
- Database layer
- Business logic
while keeping tests deterministic and isolated.

---

## Test environment

- **Local**:
- Tests are executed in a Python virtual environment using `pytest`.
- **CI (GitHub Actions)**:
- Tests are executed automatically 
- No OCI configuration or secrets are available in CI.
- All external OCI calls are mocked.
- Application import must not depend on `~/.oci/config`.

---

## Success criteria

- **100% API endpoint coverage**:
- Every exposed API endpoint has at least:
- One happy-path test
- One negative or edge-case test
- **High code coverage**:
- Aim for as close as possible to **100% coverage** of API code.
- All tests must pass consistently in GitHub Actions without external dependencies.

---

## Reporting

- **Console output**:
- Test execution and failures are visible via `pytest -v`.
- **Code coverage**:
- Coverage is measured using `pytest-cov`.
- Coverage results are uploaded to **Codecov** and displayed in pull requests.
